# Web Dev Final
Front End Web Development final

Classic "Apple Catcher" type game, with pure HTML/CSS (and the illusion of vanilla JS ‚ù§)

## Wishlist
- fruit pops when clicked
- fruit "jumps" and rotates slightly while falling
- fruit disappears into holes or shoots
- game over after 3 squirrel hits
- confetti on win screen after 3 fruit hits
- bootstrap rows + parallax = with different fruits on scroll
